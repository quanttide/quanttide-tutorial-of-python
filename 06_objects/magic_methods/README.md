> Magic methods are special methods in python that have double underscores (dunder) on both sides of the method name. Magic methods are predominantly used for operator overloading. Operator overloading means provided additional functionality to the operators, the python implicitly invokes the magic methods to provide additional functionality to it. For example, multiplying two integers can be done using the multiplying operator (2*3 = 6) and the same operator can be used to repeat the string (“apple- ” * 3 = ‘apple- apple- apple’).
> Some examples of magic methods are __init__, __len__, __repr__, __add__, and etc.
